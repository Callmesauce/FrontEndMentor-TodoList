## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to manage every code i make using functions.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1><div></div> help me a lot on separating or structuring complicated stuffs</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const [todo,setTodo]=useState([{data}])
```


### Useful resources

- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for easy styling using classes im weak at naming things haha sometimes i named my element naruto. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [ChatGpt](https://chat.openai.com/) & [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing tool and community forrum which helped me finally understand how to deploy a react+vite project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning how to deploy a react application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
